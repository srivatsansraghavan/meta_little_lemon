      <p>
        Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who
        moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a
        restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his
        experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for the
        restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian
        to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.
